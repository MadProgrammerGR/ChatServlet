# ChatServlet
A simple chat web page i made only for practice.
It uses Java Servlets for the responses and AJAX for client side requests.
My goal was to make this with servlets although it would have been very better using WebSockets instead.
HTML/CSS template was from [here](http://themeandphoto.com/bootstrap-chat-example-template/), just modified a little for simplicity.
